# Neural Network for Image Classification

This project is an l-layer neural network created for the purpose of image classification (although it can also be
trained for other tasks). A small demo is included.

## Installation

Install the required packages with pip first:

``pip install requirements.txt``

## Running the demo

Running the image-classification demo is straightforward:

1. Download this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammeddalkran/catvnoncat.
2. Place the data in a folder in the root called `data`.
3. Open `demo_train.py`, right-click and press run.
4. After it finishes do the same for `demo_predict.py`.
