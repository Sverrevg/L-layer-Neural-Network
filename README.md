# Neural Network for Image Classification

This project is an l-layer neural network created for the purpose of image classification (although it can also be
trained for other tasks). A small demo is included.

## Installation

Install the required packages with pip first:

``pip install requirements.txt``

## Running the demo

Running the image-classification demo is straightforward:

1. Open `demo_train.py`, right-click and press run.
2. After it finishes do the same for `demo_predict.py`.
