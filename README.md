# Neural Network for Image Classification
This project is an l-layer neural network created for the purpose of image classification (although it can also be 
trained for other tasks). A small demo is included.

## Installation

Install the required packages with pip first:

``pip install requirements.txt``

Then download this dataset should you like to run the demo: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammeddalkran/catvnoncat.
Place the data in a folder in the root called `data`.

## Running the demo

Running the image-classification demo is straightforward:

1. Open a terminal and paste the following `python demo_train.py`.
2. Then, paste the following `python demo_predict.py`.
